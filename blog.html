<!-- local storage vs session storage -->
<p>
    localStorage and sessionStorage are almost identical and have the same API. The difference is that with sessionStorage, the data is persisted only until the window or tab is closed. With localStorage, the data is persisted until the user manually clears the browser cache or until web app clears the data.For saving any data for a long time local storage give a better experience but session storage also give this advantage but for the website's window time.

<!-- global scope vs block scope -->

<p>A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. The global variables can be accessed by any line of code in the program, including inside blocks.
    The variables that are declared within the block scope are comparable to local ones. They are available within the block that they are defined.The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the block statements (e.g. if conditions or for loops), don't create a new scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables are still in the same scope.

<!-- How event loop works -->
<p>JavaScript is a single-threaded language. In other words, it can do only one thing at a time. JavaScript executes all operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, gives us the illusion of multi-threading. The event loop is the secret behind JavaScriptâ€™s asynchronous programming.JavaScript engine executes a script from the top and works its way down creating execution contexts and pushing and popping functions onto and off the call stack</p>


<!-- to get an undefined -->
<p>The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all.
    I am focusing on 8 most common reason to get undefined in a javascript programme</p>


<pre>
    
1.Variable that is not initialized will give  undefined
2.function with no return value
3.parameter that is not passed will be undefined
4.if return has nothing on the right side will return undefined
5.property that doesn't  exists on an object will give you undefined
6.accessing array elements outside of the index range
7.delting an element inside an array
8.set a value directly to undefined

</pre>
